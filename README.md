# Data_Driven_Astronomy
## By Positron Foundation

Modern telescopes produce terabytes of data giving rise to the big data problem in astronomy. With projects and surveys such as James Webb Space Telescope, Square Kilometre Array, Thirty Metre Telescope etc., we are looking at a new era of big data. Thus the next generation of astronomers needs a good grip on data science. 

In this workshop, we will introduce you to different data types, such as photometric, spectroscopic, and tabular data, used in modern-day astronomy through Jupyter notebooks and online interactive sessions. We will look at examples of how to extract science from different types of data and handle big data using Convolutional Neural Networks. So if you are interested in modern astronomy and want a head start on astronomical data handling, we invite you to this course.
